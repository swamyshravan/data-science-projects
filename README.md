# data-science-projects
This repository contains all the data science and data analysis projects.

The data used in the projects are also in the respective folder in the repository.

These projects contain codes inspired from several sources from the internet, the main being, stackoverflow, realpython, programmiz and scikit-learn.

# Updates
